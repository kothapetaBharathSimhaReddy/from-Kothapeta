My favorite book that I treasure is the “Harry Potter” series. It is not a single book but a series of seven novels. I have savored all of these books, and some of them even more than once. The author of these books is world-famous British author J. K. Rowling. Born Joanne Rowling in 1965 in England, she is an author, philanthropist, producer, and screenwriter. I first heard about it from my elder brother as he is a voracious reader and incepted me to these books of the wizardly world.

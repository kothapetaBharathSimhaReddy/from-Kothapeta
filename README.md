###### Takita Takita Kitchen and Bar
This  high-end fine dining restaurant has an extravagant **ambience** and stylish aura which reflects the modernity and glamorous style pf "Indian Royalty". It is my favourite restaurant mainly because they serve fresh food with the best ingredients available in the market. Moreover, I am fan of **Biryani**.
